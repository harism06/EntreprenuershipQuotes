"My observation is that there are talented people everywhere. So, bringing Silicon Valley to other places in the world is mostly a matter of culture. So there isn't a lack of talented people in other places in the world. So it's more the cultural aspects, like are people willing to take risks? is there a personal network of people you can look up to? it is a little bit difficult if you have no one to aspire to. you need role models and mentors" [~Jawed Karim, YouTube](https://youtu.be/IY8xMIU2B4c?si=QoKZiR4qID3pVQAV&t=183)

(This is a quote by Jack Dorsey that I love about true entrepreneurship.)

"I think Stanford is a really great place. I mean there's really really smart people around, and it's really a fun place to be. Some people from other startups have gone back once things sort of calmed down. For me, there are things that I want to work on that are very speculative and Stanford is a great place to do things like that. I didn't start out building a search engine. I said, 'Oh, the links on the web are probably interesting, why don't we try doing something with that.' And I was pretty lucky that that was a pretty useful thing to do. I think if you're doing something that is not going to work at all. A company isn't probably the right place to do it." ~Larry Page, Google

"Y Combinator found out there was a huge amount of value to unlock by finding unknown people that are really talented but don't have a network and giving them resources." ~Sam Altman, OpenAI & YC

"All men are created equal" ~Thomas Jefferson, USA
